# OCS: Fast &amp; Simple Objective-C to Swift Converter

## What is OCS?

OCS is a C program written to ease the transition from legacy Objective-C code to Swift. Currently, many organisations & companies cannot migrate to Swift, because of the lengthy manual work.

Now, they can simply input their Objective-C source files, and get newly generated Swift files as a result. And that is all with a simple click.

Right now, this application is under development; however, small changes will be posted. Do make sure to watch the repo! This project will become big; so, pull requests, new issues, and wiki updates are welcomed and responded within 24 hours.

## What features are going to be present?

- A simple GUI to manage the conversion
- A website to convert code snippets

## What exactly can we convert?

- Full source files
- Method Declarations

- Full Xcode projects
